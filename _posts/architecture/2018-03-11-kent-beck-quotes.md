## 正文
1. 软件设计者应该是分离应该分离事物，而不是将本应一起考虑的事情进行分离。
1. I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.
2. Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
3. Responsibility cannot be assigned; it can only be accepted. If someone tries to give you responsibility, only you can decide if you are responsible or if you aren't. 
4. The XP philosophy is to start where you are now and move towards the ideal. From where you are now, could you improve a little bit
5. Without planning, we are individuals with haphazard connections and effectiveness. We are a team when we plan and work in harmony.
6. Saying that programmers should just accomplish twice as much doesn't work. They can gain skills and effectiveness, but they cannot get more done on demand. More time at the desk does not equal increased productivity for creative work.
7. Beta testing is a symptom of weak testing practices and poor communication with customers.
8. McConnell writes, "In ten years the pendulum has swung from 'design everything' to 'design nothing.' But the alternative to BDUF [Big Design Up Front] isn't no design up front, it's a Little Design Up Front (LDUF) or Enough Design Up Front (ENUF)." This is a strawman argument. The alternative to designing before implementing is designing after implementing.
9. the XP strategy is design always.
10. Without the adjustment, you are working under a lie. Everyone knows it and has to hide to protect themselves. This is no way to get good software done and deployed;
11. Cards on a wall is a way of practicing transparency, valuing and respecting the input of each team member. The project manager has the task of translating the cards into whatever format is expected by the rest of the organization.
12. However, most defects end up costing more than it would have cost to prevent them. Defects are expensive when they occur, both the direct costs of fixing the defects and the indirect costs because of damaged relationships, lost business, and lost development time.
13. Used Pluggable Adaptor, which we promise not to use again for four months, minimum, because it makes code hard to statically analyze.
14. Given the choice between an extremely skilled loner and a competent-but-social programmer, XP teams consistently choose the more social candidate. The best interviewing technique is to have the candidate work with the team for a day. Pair programming provides an excellent test of technical and social skills.
15. If you have a month to plan a project in detail, spend it on four one-week iterations developing while you improve your estimates. If you have a week to plan a project, hold five one-day iterations. Feedback cycles give you information and the experience to make accurate estimates.
16. Inaccurate estimates are a failure of information, not of values or principles. If the numbers are wrong, fix the numbers and communicate the consequences
17. Some of the teams who read and applied the first edition of this book didn't get the part of the message about the last responsible moment. They piled story on story as quickly as possible with the least possible investment in design. Without daily attention to design, the cost of changes does skyrocket. The result is poorly designed, brittle, hard-to-change systems.
18. If I have the same logic in two places, I work with the design to understand how I can have only one copy. Designs without duplication tend to be easy to change
19. Pair programmers: Keep each other on task. Brainstorm refinements to the system. Clarify ideas. Take initiative when their partner is stuck, thus lowering frustration. Hold each other accountable to the team's practices. Pairing
20. Sit Together Develop in an open space big enough for the whole team. Meet the need for privacy and "owned" space by having small private spaces nearby or by limiting work hours so team members can get their privacy needs met elsewhere.s
